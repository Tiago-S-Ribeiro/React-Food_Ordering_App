    <h1>React.js Expense Tracker</h1>
</div>

This is a restaurant application using React.js, done as a code-along with Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on his [Udemy web course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

Here's a gif demonstrating the app (for some reason Github displays it a bit on slow-motion). :D
![App](./Files/app.gif)

<p text-align="justify">This application allows the addition of a set of meals to the cart, increase the amount, decrease or entirely remove them. The cart badge has an animation with box-shadow and translation, and it also bumps everytime a meal is added, to add a bit of eye-candy and make it less rigid.</p>
<br/>
To try this out, just download this repository, open your terminal inside the desired location and simply run:

<br/>

```
npm install
npm start
```
